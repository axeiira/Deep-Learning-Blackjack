# Black Jack Games with Computer Vision

## Project Overview
"BlackJack Games with Computer Vision" is an innovative project that combines **OpenCV**, **Python**, and **deep learning** to create a smart Black Jack card game system. The project uses computer vision techniques to detect, recognize, and process playing cards in real-time, creating an interactive and automated gaming experience.

## Features
- Real-time card detection and recognition using **OpenCV**.
- Utilizes **deep learning** for enhanced card classification.
- Interactive gameplay with automated game logic.
- Visual feedback to simulate a Black Jack game.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)**

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the card recognition model is available on Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:

[Kaggle Cards Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification)

**Instructions to Download:**
1. Go to the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification).
2. Click on the "Download" button to get the dataset.
3. Extract the dataset and place it in the `datasets/` folder in your project directory.
